description: Overview of the CTF FlagFrenzy frontend implementation
---

The CTF FlagFrenzy frontend is built using SvelteKit, in combination with Tailwind CSS.

## Technology Stack

- SvelteKit for UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart JS for the graph

## Folder Tree
Here you can see the folder tree of the flagfrenzy-sveltekit. These are only the files and folders that are important for the design of the frontend, so the overall folder tree is much bigger. The tailwind.config.js is where Tailwind can be customized. The postcss.config.js is important for the post apply of css parts. In the static folder are the favicon and images stored. The src folder is where all the html, css and svelte pages are stored. In the lib/components folder are all svelte pages which are only used in other pages like the Footer.svelte, which is used in the + layout.svelte.
