| Table Name | Foreign Key | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| Teams | TeamLeader | Stores information about teams, including their name, key (random string length(24)), total points, password and number of members, sharedFlags, firstBloods. |
| Users | TeamsID | Holds user data such as nickname, points, email, an avatar picture name, if the user is disabled and optionally links users to a team. The ID includes the name of the user and the class. |
| User_made_challenges | User_ID, Challenges_ID | Tracks user progress on challenges, recording if they've solved it and if they are the first to do so, saving the URL of the deployed container. It is the Many-to-Many table between Users and Challenges. Saves also the URL for the Container of the Challenge and the creation time. |
| Challenges | / | Contains details about challenges, including their name, a formatted name for the deployment, category, points, how often hints are used, descriptions, hints, the static flag, reference to another challenge, an attribute to determine if it’s a static challenge and difficulty. |
| TeamPoints | TeamID | Contains the team with their points over time. It is important for the graph in the GUI, especially for the admin panel. |
| TeamPointsUser | TeamID | Contains the team with their points over time. It is important for the graph in the GUI, especially for the user scoreboard. It makes an entry every 10 minutes. |
