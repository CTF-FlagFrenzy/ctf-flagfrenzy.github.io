<h1 style={{ textAlign: "center", color: '#f0c056', fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '36px' }}>Management</h1>
<p style={{ textAlign: "justify", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>The project, under the management of PLONER Fabian and the supervision of RABENSTEINER Reiner, progressed with strong leadership and clear direction. While initial internal conflicts arose, they were quickly resolved through firm yet respectful project management, fostering a focused and cooperative team dynamic. Communication, structured from the project manager through the team leader to team members, worked efficiently for the most part. However, good management alone is not enough—motivated and committed team members played a crucial role in the project’s success. Once aligned, the team worked together perfectly, ensuring smooth execution and problem-solving. From a management perspective, the project was nearly flawless, with only minor errors, demonstrating the importance of both strong leadership and a dedicated, well-coordinated team.</p>

  <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '20px' }}>Backend</h2>
  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>My name is Elias Pinter and I was the team leader of the Platform team and responsible for the backend of the web app. I learned a lot about the possibilities of ORMs. I like very much to work with APIs and databases. The backend is one of the most important things because it communicates with the cluster and the GUI. As team leader, I was responsible for the successful completion of the Platform, which includes the cluster, backend, anti-cheat and GUI. I wish you good luck!</p>

  <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '20px' }}>Anti-Cheat</h2>
  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>As part of the development team, I focused on implementing the anti-cheat functionality for our platform. My main tasks included creating mechanisms to validate flag submissions, detect shared flags, and apply penalties for incorrect submissions. What I enjoyed the most was designing the logic to calculate points based on submission time and handling various edge cases. Through this project, I learned a lot about secure coding practices and the importance of robust validation in maintaining the integrity of a competitive environment.</p>

  <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '20px' }}>Frontend</h2>
  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>As part of the development team, I was responsible for the frontend of the web app. Throughout this project, I learned how to effectively use Tailwind CSS for styling and how to work with SVGs to create dynamic and visually appealing UI elements. One of the most exciting aspects of this experience was translating design concepts into an interactive and responsive interface. This project gave me valuable insights into modern frontend development and the importance of user experience in web applications.</p>

  <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '20px' }}>Cluster</h2>
  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>I conducted the management of the cluster through the utilization of a local private Docker registry, employing HTTPS for storing and organizing all challenges. Initially, I attempted to deploy them with Docker Swarm, however, I soon discovered that this wasn‘t an option due to the fact that Swarm doesn‘t support rootless Docker. This necessitated my transition to K3s, a process that proved to be both time-consuming and daunting. Despite the challenges encountered, I ultimately completed the process. Reflecting upon it, I recognize the invaluable opportunity to expand my skillset and accumulate knowledge.</p>

  <h2 style={{ textAlign: "center", fontWeight: '700', fontSize: '20px' }}>OSINT</h2>
  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>My role in this project was that of the deputy project manager and the team leader of the Challenges team. I was also responsible for creating the challenges in the OSINT and Steganography categories. I especially enjoyed developing and testing these challenges, always keeping in mind that they were meant to engage and challenge the participants of the CTF event. It was exciting to figure out how to design tasks that were neither too easy nor too difficult. Along the way, I learned various new techniques that will definitely be useful in the future.</p>

  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>In the course of the school's annual TopHack event, I was able to participate in the project FlagFrenzy as a controller which resulted in learning to do management with Jira. Additionally, as part of the challenge team, I helped with the development of the challenges - especially in the categories “Others” and “Forensics”. Overall, it was a great honor for me to be part of such a great team and to prepare the CTF together with my colleagues.</p>

  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>I'm a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast who excels in solving complex challenges. My best achievement was successfully completing the "Hidden Job" challenge, where I combined web analysis, reverse engineering, and physical awareness to uncover hidden flags. Through this experience, I learned the importance of meticulous analysis and the value of exploring every detail. I utilized various tools and techniques, including web tools and URL hopping, to achieve my goals. This challenge honed my skills and deepened my understanding of cybersecurity principles.</p>

  <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify', padding: '10px', marginBottom: '4rem' }}>Better late than never! I joined the team mid development and contributed three of the challenges in that time since. I very much liked the development of the challenges and the overall progress of this project. Because I joined late, I couldn’t contribute more challenges, nevertheless I learned a lot about how CTF challenges are built. Lastly, I learned how to become a member of an established team in timely fashion. Have fun and succeed with the challenges!</p>
