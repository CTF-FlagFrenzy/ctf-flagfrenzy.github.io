Some Text

## üß† Context and Reasoning

To enable dynamic deployment and management of CTF challenges (or other applications) without granting direct cluster access (e.g., `kubectl`) to end-users or a primary web application, a dedicated API service is introduced.

This service, built using FastAPI, runs on the K3s master nodes and exposes secure endpoints (`/deploy`, `/deprovision`, `/teamkey`). When called (e.g., by a central CTF platform webapp), this API service translates the requests into `kubectl` commands executed against the K3s cluster, using predefined templates and scripts. This abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes interactions and provides a controlled interface.

## üß± Architecture Overview (Placeholder)

*(Placeholder: Diagram showing: External Caller (e.g., CTF Webapp) -> Load Balancer (port 443/HTTPS, specific paths like /deploy) -> FastAPI Service (Container on Master, port 8080) -> Executes kubectl commands using mounted kubeconfig -> K3s API Server)*

**Workflow:**

1.  An external system (e.g., CTF frontend) needs to deploy a challenge for a team.
2.  It sends an authenticated POST request to the LB, e.g., `https://challenge.web.ctf.htl-villach.at/deploy`, with team and challenge details.
3.  The LB proxies this request (based on path and potentially source IP rules) to the FastAPI service running on a master node.
4.  The FastAPI service validates the request (API key) and parameters.
5.  It executes a local script (`deploy.sh`) which uses `envsubst` to populate Kubernetes manifest templates (`deployment.yml`, `ingress.yml`) with team/challenge details and a generated subdomain.
6.  The script uses `kubectl apply -f -` to create the Deployment, Service, and Ingress resources in a team-specific namespace. `kubectl` uses a mounted kubeconfig file to authenticate with the K3s API server.
7.  The FastAPI service returns the generated URL (from the Ingress) to the caller.
8.  Similar workflows exist for creating team secrets (`/teamkey`) and removing resources (`/deprovision`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

The detailed setup of the FastAPI service, its endpoints, scripts, and deployment is covered in:

* **`cluster/fastapi-endpoints.mdx`:** FastAPI code (`main.py`), Dockerfile, Docker Compose setup, API Key.
* **`cluster/challenge-deployment.mdx`:** Bash scripts (`deploy.sh`, `deprovision.sh`, `teamkey.sh`) and Kubernetes YAML templates (`deployment.yml`, `ingress.yml`).
* **`cluster/traffic-routing.mdx`:** Nginx configuration on the Load Balancer to route requests to the FastAPI service.
* **`cluster/secrets.mdx`:** Handling the API Key and the Kubernetes secrets for team keys.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips, Caveats, Troubleshooting

* **Security:** The API Key (`API_KEY`) must be kept secret. The LB configuration includes IP address restrictions (`allow <webapp_IP>; deny all;`) for the API endpoints, adding a layer of network security. Consider further security measures if needed (mTLS, more robust auth).
* **Error Handling:** The FastAPI code includes basic error handling, raising HTTPExceptions on script failures or invalid requests. Enhance logging and error reporting as needed.
* **Idempotency:** `kubectl apply` is largely idempotent, making the `/deploy` endpoint relatively safe to call multiple times (it will update existing resources). `/deprovision` uses `kubectl delete`, which is also idempotent (it won't fail if the resource is already gone). `/teamkey` uses `kubectl create`, which *will* fail if the namespace or secret already exists; consider adding checks or using `apply` for secrets too.
* **Resource Management:** Ensure the deployment scripts clean up all associated resources (Deployment, Service, Ingress, potentially Namespace if desired) during deprovisioning.
* **Kubeconfig:** The FastAPI container needs access to a valid kubeconfig file with sufficient permissions to manage resources in the cluster. The example uses RBAC to create a dedicated service account (`deployer`) with limited permissions (`edit` role in `default` namespace, though scripts create resources in *new* namespaces, potentially requiring broader permissions like `cluster-admin` or more granular RoleBindings per-namespace). See `cluster/secrets.mdx` discussion on RBAC.
