Some Text

## üß† Context and Reasoning

Storing sensitive data directly in configuration files (`docker-compose.yml`, `deployment.yml`) or scripts is insecure. Using environment variables is better but can still expose secrets in logs or process inspection. Kubernetes Secrets provide a centralized and more secure way to manage this data:

* Secrets are stored within the Kubernetes datastore (etcd or, in this case, the external MySQL DB).
* They can be mounted as volumes or exposed as environment variables only to the pods that need them.
* RBAC can control who can access or modify secrets.

## üß± Concept and Architecture

Secrets are sensitive pieces of information like passwords, API keys, tokens, and TLS certificates. Kubernetes provides a dedicated `Secret` resource type for managing this data securely within the cluster. This infrastructure utilizes secrets for:

* K3s Cluster Initialization (Join Token)
* K3s External Datastore Access (MySQL Credentials)
* Private Docker Registry Access (Registry Credentials)
* Application Configuration (Team Keys)
* API Access Control (FastAPI Key)
* TLS Communication (Certificates and Keys)

*(Placeholder: Briefly discuss Kubernetes Secret encoding (Base64) and best practices like avoiding storing secrets directly in Git, using tools like Vault or Sealed Secrets for more advanced scenarios if applicable).*

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. K3s Token & Datastore Credentials

* **Context:** Used during K3s server and agent installation.
* **Implementation:** Handled via environment variables (`K3S_TOKEN`, `K3S_DATASTORE_ENDPOINT`) during the `curl | sh -` installation process. These values are sourced from an `.env` file shared between the Load Balancer and K3s nodes.
    ```bash
    # Example .env file content (on Load Balancer)
    MYSQL_DATABASE=k3s
    MYSQL_USER=k3s
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=MySuperSecurePassw0rd
    # ... other DB vars
    K3S_TOKEN=MySuperSecureT0ken

    # On K3s nodes before install:
    source .env
    export K3S_DATASTORE_ENDPOINT='mysql://'$MYSQL_USER':'$MYSQL_PASSWORD'@tcp('$MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST':'$MYSQL_DATABASE_PORT')/'$MYSQL_DATABASE
    # Run K3s install script...
    ```

### 2. Private Registry Credentials

* **Context:** Allows K3s nodes (kubelet/containerd) to pull images from the secured private registry.
* **Implementation:** A Kubernetes `docker-registry` secret is created on a master node. This secret is referenced in Deployment manifests (`imagePullSecrets`).
    ```bash
    # Run on a master node (adjust credentials/server)
    kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-credentials \
      --docker-server=https://registry:5000 \
      --docker-username=myuser \
      --docker-password=mypassword

    # Verify
    kubectl describe secret registry-credentials

    # Referenced in Deployment YAML:
    # spec:
    #   template:
    #     spec:
    #       imagePullSecrets:
    #       - name: registry-credentials
    #       containers:
    #       - name: my-app
    #         image: registry:5000/my-image
    ```
* **Note:** Agent nodes also need specific configuration in `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` to use these credentials and trust the registry's certificate (See `cluster/internal-registry.mdx`).

### 3. Team Keys for Challenges

* **Context:** Unique keys/flags provided to challenge instances for specific teams.
* **Implementation:** Created dynamically via the FastAPI `/teamkey` endpoint, which executes the `teamkey.sh` script. This script creates a standard Kubernetes `generic` secret within a team-specific namespace.
    ```bash
    # teamkey.sh excerpt:
    kubectl create namespace namespace-team-$TEAMID
    kubectl create secret generic teamkey-$TEAMID \
      --from-literal=TEAMKEY=$TEAMKEY \
      -n namespace-team-$TEAMID

    # Referenced in Deployment YAML as environment variable:
    # spec:
    #   template:
    #     spec:
    #       containers:
    #       - name: ${CHALLENGE}
    #         # ...
    #         env:
    #         - name: TEAMKEY
    #           valueFrom:
    #             secretKeyRef:
    #               name: teamkey-${TEAMID}
    #               key: TEAMKEY
    ```

### 4. FastAPI API Key

* **Context:** Secures the `/deploy`, `/deprovision`, and `/teamkey` endpoints.
* **Implementation:** Passed as an environment variable (`API_KEY`) to the FastAPI container via the `docker-compose.yml` file using an `.env` file. The API checks the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.
    ```yaml
    # docker-compose.yml for FastAPI service
    services:
      deployment-api:
        # ...
        env_file: .env
        environment:
          - API_KEY=${API_KEY}
        # ...

    # .env file
    API_KEY=mySuperSecureKey
    ```

### 5. TLS Certificates

* **Context:** Used for securing communication (HTTPS) for the Registry, Load Balancer endpoints, K3s API Server, Kubernetes Dashboard, etc.
* **Implementation:**
    * Generated using `openssl req -x509 ...`. Ensure correct hostnames/IPs are in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.
    * Stored on the filesystem of relevant hosts/containers and referenced in configurations (Nginx `ssl_certificate`, Docker Registry `REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE`, K3s `--tls-san`).
    * For Kubernetes resources like Ingress or the Dashboard, TLS certificates can be stored as `kubernetes.io/tls` secrets, although this setup primarily uses filesystem mounts for Nginx/Registry certs. The Grafana example shows creating a TLS secret:
        ```bash
        # Example for Grafana (not fully implemented in provided docs)
        # openssl req -x509 ... -keyout domain.key -out domain.crt
        kubectl create secret tls grafana-tls \
          --namespace monitoring \
          --cert=domain.crt \
          --key=domain.key
        ```

### 6. (Optional) Service Account Tokens

* **Context:** The `Cluster-Webapp-Interaction.md` guide includes steps to create a `deployer` Service Account and use its token for `kubectl` within the FastAPI container, potentially limiting permissions compared to using the admin `k3s.yaml`.
* **Implementation:** Involves `kubectl create serviceaccount`, `kubectl create rolebinding`, manually creating/patching a secret for the token (if needed on older K8s versions), retrieving the token, and mounting a specific kubeconfig file using this token into the FastAPI container.
* **Caveat:** The guide notes this might be unnecessary ("It does not have to be done - already secure"), potentially implying the default `k3s.yaml` was deemed acceptable for this use case. Evaluate based on your security requirements.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips, Caveats, Troubleshooting

* **Permissions:** Ensure file permissions for certificate keys and htpasswd files are restrictive.
* **Secret Naming:** Use consistent and descriptive names for secrets.
* **Namespaces:** Be mindful of namespaces when creating and referencing secrets (e.g., `registry-credentials` is cluster-wide or in `default`, `teamkey-*` are in `namespace-team-*`).
* **Backup:** Secrets stored in Kubernetes are part of the cluster state. Ensure your backup strategy for the K3s datastore (MySQL) includes this data.
* **Rotation:** Implement a strategy for rotating secrets (especially TLS certificates and API keys) regularly. The current setup uses certificates valid for 365 days.

## üìÑ Clear formatting, tested shell/YAML blocks

Commands for creating secrets (`kubectl create secret`, `htpasswd`) and YAML snippets referencing secrets are provided. Ensure placeholder values (usernames, passwords, keys, server names) are replaced correctly.
