## üß† Context and Reasoning

Setting up and using a private registry can sometimes lead to issues related to TLS configuration, authentication, networking, or client setup. This section provides guidance on common problems.

## üß± Architecture Overview (Placeholder)

*(Placeholder: Briefly mention key interaction points prone to issues: Client / Registry Host:5000 (TLS, Auth), Nginx / Registry Service (TLS), Nginx / UI)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps (Troubleshooting Steps)

1.  **Check Container Logs:**
    Inspect the logs of the registry, Nginx, and UI containers for errors.
    ```bash
    # On the registry host
    docker logs <registry_container_name_or_id>
    docker logs <nginx_container_name_or_id>
    docker logs <registry-ui_container_name_or_id>
    ```

2.  **Verify Network Connectivity:**
    From a client machine, check if you can reach the registry host and the exposed ports (Nginx: 8443, Registry: 5000, Portainer: 9443). Use `ping`, `telnet`, or `nc`.
    ```bash
    ping web.ctf.htl-villach.at
    telnet web.ctf.htl-villach.at 5000 # Should connect if port is open, Ctrl+] then 'quit'
    telnet web.ctf.htl-villach.at 8443 # Should connect
    ```
    Check firewalls on the registry host and client.

3.  **Test TLS Connection:**
    Use `openssl` to check the certificate presented by the registry service directly.
    ```bash
    # Check cert on port 5000
    openssl s_client -connect web.ctf.htl-villach.at:5000 -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text
    ```
    Verify the issuer, subject, and Subject Alternative Names (SANs) match expectations. Check validity dates.

4.  **Test Nginx Proxy TLS:**
    Check the certificate presented by the Nginx proxy.
    ```bash
    # Check cert on port 8443
    openssl s_client -connect web.ctf.htl-villach.at:8443 -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text
    ```

5.  **Verify Client Docker Configuration:**
    * Ensure the CA certificate is correctly placed in `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry_host>:<port>/ca.crt` or trusted system-wide.
    * Confirm the directory name *exactly* matches the registry host and port used in `docker login`.
    * Restart the Docker daemon after changes: `sudo systemctl restart docker`.

6.  **Check Authentication:**
    * Verify the `htpasswd` file exists and is correctly mounted into the registry container (`/auth/registry.password`).
    * Ensure the username/password used for `docker login` are correct.
    * Check the `REGISTRY_AUTH*` settings in `docker-compose.yaml`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Tips

* **`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`**:
    * **Cause:** Client Docker daemon doesn't trust the registry's CA certificate.
    * **Fix:** Ensure the CA cert (`domain.crt`) is correctly added to the system trust store (`dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates` on Debian/Ubuntu) or placed in `/etc/docker/certs.d/registry.host:5000/ca.crt`. Restart the Docker daemon or reboot the client machine. Verify the hostname/port match.
* **`connection refused`**:
    * **Cause:** Registry container not running, port not exposed correctly, firewall blocking access, or incorrect hostname/IP used.
    * **Fix:** Check container status (`docker ps`), verify `ports` in `docker-compose.yaml`, check host firewall (`sudo ufw status` or `firewall-cmd --list-all`), verify DNS/IP.
* **`502 Bad Gateway` (when accessing UI via Nginx)**:
    * **Cause:** Nginx cannot connect to the backend service (registry or UI). Often due to Nginx not trusting the backend's self-signed certificate (if registry service uses TLS internally) or the backend service not running.
    * **Fix:** Check Nginx logs. Check backend container logs. If registry uses TLS internally, ensure Nginx `proxy_ssl_verify` and `proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate` are correct, or use `proxy_ssl_verify off;` (less secure) for testing. Ensure backend services are running and accessible *within* the Docker network.
* **Authentication Errors (`unauthorized: authentication required`)**:
    * **Cause:** Missing or incorrect `docker login`, incorrect credentials, misconfigured `htpasswd` file or registry auth settings.
    * **Fix:** Run `docker login` before push/pull. Verify username/password. Check `htpasswd` file contents and registry container environment variables/mounts.
* **Image Deletion Issues:**
    * **Cause:** Deletion is enabled (`REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED: 'true'`), but space isn't freed until garbage collection runs.
    * **Fix:** To reclaim space, you need to run the registry garbage collector. This typically involves `exec`-ing into the registry container. Consult the official Docker Registry garbage collection documentation.
    ```bash
    # Example (consult docs for specifics, might require registry in read-only mode temporarily)
    # docker exec <registry_container_id> bin/registry garbage-collect /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
    ```
