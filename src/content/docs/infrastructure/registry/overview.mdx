Some Text 

## üß† Context and Reasoning

A private Docker registry is essential for this infrastructure to host custom-built container images, such as the CTF challenges. Using a private registry ensures that images are readily available within the cluster network without relying on public registries like Docker Hub. This also provides better control over image access and security.

This setup uses the official `registry:2` image, secured with TLS (HTTPS) and basic authentication (`htpasswd`). An Nginx proxy is used to handle TLS termination and route requests, while a companion UI (`joxit/docker-registry-ui`) provides a web interface for Browse the registry content.

## üß± Architecture Overview (Placeholder)

*(Placeholder: Add a simple diagram showing Client -> Nginx (Port 8443/HTTPS) -> Registry UI / Registry Service (Port 5000/HTTPS within Docker network))*

**Components:**

* **Docker Registry (`registry:2`):** Stores the actual image layers. Configured for TLS, htpasswd authentication, and image deletion.
* **Registry UI (`joxit/docker-registry-ui`):** Provides a web interface to view repositories and tags. Connects to the registry service.
* **Nginx:** Acts as a reverse proxy, exposing the UI and registry API (`/v2/`) via a single HTTPS port (8443). Handles TLS termination using provided certificates.
* **Authentication (`htpasswd`):** Basic authentication restricts push/pull access.
* **Certificates (`openssl`):** Self-signed certificates enable HTTPS.
* **Portainer (Optional):** Included for managing the registry stack containers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

1.  **Setup:** Prepare directories, generate authentication credentials (`htpasswd`), and create TLS certificates (`openssl`). (Covered in `setup.mdx`)
2.  **Deployment:** Define and deploy the services (Registry, UI, Nginx, Portainer) using `docker-compose`. (Covered in `setup.mdx`)
3.  **Usage:** Configure Docker clients (and K3s agents) to trust the registry's certificate and use the credentials to log in, push, and pull images. (Covered in `usage.mdx`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips, Caveats, Troubleshooting

* The registry requires `htpasswd` credentials generated with bcrypt (`-B` flag).
* Ensure the hostname/DNS names used during certificate generation match how clients will access the registry. Add all relevant names (hostname, `registry`, `web.ctf.htl-villach.at`) to the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN).
* Client machines (including K3s nodes) must be configured to trust the registry's CA certificate.
* Image deletion is enabled but might require garbage collection to free up space (consult Docker Registry documentation).

## üìÑ Clear Formatting, Tested Shell/YAML Blocks

The configuration files (`docker-compose.yaml`, `nginx.conf`) and setup commands are detailed in `setup.mdx`. Usage commands are in `usage.mdx`.
