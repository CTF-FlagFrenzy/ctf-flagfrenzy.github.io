title: "CTF Reversing | Corrupted File: Medium"
description: A challenge involving identification and correction of a corrupted file signature to retrieve a hidden flag
---

Corrupted File is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed to test participants' ability to identify and correct a corrupted file signature to extract contents and find a hidden flag. The challenge involves examining and fixing a file with a corrupted signature.

#### Directory Structure
```
Corrupted_File/
├── app/
│   └── main.py
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── docker-compose.yml
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The challenge uses a microservice architecture built with the following components:

1. **FastAPI Application** (`main.py`): Handles the flag generation and serving the corrupted file.
2. **Docker Environment** (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`): Sets up the containerized environment.

### Component 1: FastAPI Application (`main.py`)

The main.py script is the core of this challenge. It generates a flag by combining a team key and a challenge key, creates a file with this flag, compresses it into a tar.gz archive, and deliberately corrupts the file signature by replacing the first two bytes to hide the file type.

#### Full Source Code:

```python
import hashlib
import os
import tarfile

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

if os.environ.get("TEAMKEY") is None:
    load_dotenv()

debug = os.getenv("DEBUG", "False") == "True"
print(debug)

team_key = os.getenv("TEAMKEY")
challenge_key = "kjasdhasidz8a2e2kwhdoizdshdmas"
combined_flag = challenge_key + team_key
hashed_flag = f"FF{{{hashlib.sha256(combined_flag.encode()).hexdigest()}}}"
if debug:
    print(f"Team Key: {team_key}")
    print(f"Challenge Key: {challenge_key}")
    print(f"Flag: {hashed_flag}")

# create a text file with the flag
with open("flag.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(hashed_flag)

# compress the file to a tar.gz file
with tarfile.open("document", "w:gz") as tar:
    tar.add("flag.txt")

# replace the first two bytes from the archive from 0x1f 0x8b to 0x00 0x00 to hide the file type
# makes it practically impossible without altering the bytes back
with open("document", "r+b") as f:
    f.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the file
    f.write(b"\x00\x00")  # Write the new bytes


app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    file_path = "document"
    # send some additional headers because firefox can't be normal
    headers = {"Content-Disposition": 'attachment; filename="document"'}
    return FileResponse(file_path, headers=headers)
```

#### Key Features:

1. **Flag Generation**: Combines a team key and challenge key, then hashes them to create the flag.
2. **File Compression**: Compresses the flag file into a tar.gz archive.
3. **Signature Corruption**: Deliberately corrupts the gzip file signature by replacing the first two bytes.
4. **File Serving**: Uses FastAPI to serve the corrupted file to users.

### Component 2: Docker Environment (`docker-compose.yml`)

The Docker environment sets up the containerized service for running the challenge.

#### Docker Compose File:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  challenge:
    container_name: corrupted-file
    build: .
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    environment:
      - TEAMKEY=team1
      - CHALLENGE=Cupped0-Many7
      - DEBUG="False"
```

#### Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /code

COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt

COPY ./app /code/app

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
```

#### Key Features:

1. **Environment Setup**: Configures the Python environment with necessary dependencies.
2. **Challenge Configuration**: Sets environment variables for the team key and challenge key.
3. **Service Deployment**: Maps port 80 for web access to the challenge.

**HAVE FUN**

## Challenge Writeup

### Step 1: Identify the Corruption

The provided file has its first two bytes altered from `0x1f 0x8b` (the signature for a gzip file) to `0x00 0x00`. Use a hex editor or a similar tool to inspect the first few bytes of the file.

### Step 2: Correct the File Signature

Change the first two bytes back to `0x1f 0x8b` to restore the gzip file signature. This can be done using a hex editor or a Python script like the one below:

```python
import os

def correct_file_signature(file_path):
    try:
        if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")
        
        with open(file_path, 'r+b') as f:
            f.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the file
            f.write(b'\x1f\x8b')  # Write the correct gzip signature
        print(f"File signature corrected for: {file_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Usage
# Replace 'document' with the actual file path
correct_file_signature('document')
```

### Step 3: Extract the Contents

Once the file signature is corrected, use a tool like `tar` to extract the contents of the tar.gz archive. This will extract the `flag.txt` file containing the flag.

```sh
tar -xzf document
```

### Key Insights

1. File signatures (magic bytes) are crucial for identifying file types.
2. Corrupting these signatures can make files unrecognizable to standard tools.
3. Understanding file formats allows for manual repair of corrupted files.

### Tools Used

* Hex editor
* Python
* tar command-line utility
