`Hidden Frequencies` is a challenge where several steps are needed to get the flag.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

This challenge has .. parts:

    1. **Creation of audio file**
    2. **Picture with imbedded file**
    3. **Docker Configuration**

### Component 1: Creation of audio file

- To create the audio file containing the flag, the flag was written on a picture with white background. This file then was converted to a audio file, where the spectogram looked like the flag on the picture.

### Component 2: Picture with imbedded file

- Make a .zip file out of it, so it can be imedded in the image.
- Hide the .zip file with steghide inside the picture. It has to be a .bmp and big enough to contain it.
- When asked, set a password.
- Hide the password at the end of the file, so that when using cat at the end of the output the password is displayed.

### Component 3: Docker Configuration

#### Docker compose (`docker-compose.yml`):
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  challenge:
    build: challenge/
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### Dockerfile (`challenge/Dockerfile`):
```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Python image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy necessary files
COPY script.py .
COPY hidden_frequencies.bmp .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install flask

# Expose port 5000
EXPOSE 80

# Run the server
CMD ["python", "script.py"]
```

**HAVE FUN**

## Challenge Writeup

### Step 1: Find password

- When attempting to extract data using steghide, we are prompted for a passphrase. Since no password is provided, we need to find it within the file itself.
- After running this command, we find the password needed for steghide.

### Step 2: Extract hidden file

- Now that we have the password, we can use steghide to extract the hidden file. This will extract a compressed archive (.tar.gz).
- Extract the archive:

### Step 3: Analysing audio file

- Since the challenge name suggests something related to frequencies, we should inspect the spectrogram of the audio file.
- Open the audio file in Audacity, click on the track name and select Spectrogram View. The flag will be displayed within the frequency spectrum

### Tools Used

* steghide
* cat
* Audacity

### Conclusion

This challenge combined steganography (Steghide), forensics (strings analysis), and audio analysis (spectrogram) to hide and reveal the flag. Players needed to think outside the box and explore multiple data-hiding techniques.
