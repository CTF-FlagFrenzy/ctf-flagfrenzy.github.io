description: File And Seek challenge
---

File And Seek is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed to test participants' web enumeration skills. In this challenge, participants need to find a hidden file within a web application that contains cryptocurrency product information. Each product's ID section contains a part of the flag, which must be assembled to complete the challenge.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The challenge uses a microservice architecture built with the following components:

1. **Web Server** (`app.py`): A Flask application that serves the main page and hidden file.
2. **Flag Generator** (`create_json.py`): A Python script that generates the encoded flag and embeds it in product IDs.
3. **Containerization** (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`): Configuration for deployment and isolation.

### Component 1: Web Server (`app.py`)

The main entry point for the challenge is a Flask application that serves two primary routes:

```python
import subprocess
from flask import Flask, render_template, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    # Generate the hidden file with the flag when the main page is accessed
    subprocess.run(["python", "flask_app/create_json.py"])
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/security.txt")
def hidden_file():
    import os
    # Serve the hidden file containing the flag parts
    return send_from_directory(os.path.join(app.root_path, "hidden"), "security.txt")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=80)
```

#### Key Features:

1. **Root Endpoint (`/`)**
   - Triggers the flag generation script
   - Renders the main index page (financial dashboard)
   - Acts as a distraction with no hints about the hidden file

2. **Hidden Endpoint (`/security.txt`)**
   - Serves the hidden file containing flag parts
   - Finding this endpoint is a key part of the challenge
   - Requires web enumeration tools to discover

### Component 2: Flag Generator (`create_json.py`)

This script is responsible for:
- Generating a unique flag based on a challenge key and team-specific key
- Splitting the flag into parts
- Embedding flag parts in product IDs in a JSON file

```python
import hashlib
import json
import logging
import os

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",
    datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Load the product data from products.json
with open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "products.json"), "r") as json_file:
    data = json.load(json_file)
    products = data["products"]

# Generate a unique flag by combining challenge key and team key
challengeflag = "#74q$j&zcB"
teamflag = os.environ.get("TEAMKEY")
combined_flag = challengeflag + teamflag

if combined_flag:
    # Create a SHA-256 hash of the combined flag with the FF{...} format
    hashed_flag = "FF{" + hashlib.sha256(combined_flag.encode()).hexdigest() + "}"
    logger.info("Flag successfully created and hashed: %s", hashed_flag)
else:
    logger.error(
        "Failed to create flag. Ensure TEAMKEY and CHALLENGEKEY are set in environment variables."
    )
    hashed_flag = "FLAG_NOT_DEFINED"

# Split the flag into 9 parts to assign to each product
part_length = len(hashed_flag) // 9
hashed_flag_parts = [
    hashed_flag[i: i + part_length] for i in range(0, part_length * 8, part_length)
]
hashed_flag_parts.append(hashed_flag[part_length * 8:])

logger.info("Hashed flag parts created: %s", hashed_flag_parts)

# Assign each flag part as the ID of a product
for i, product in enumerate(products):
    try:
        product["id"] = hashed_flag_parts[i]
        logger.info(
            "Assigned ID %s to product %s", hashed_flag_parts[i], product["name"]
        )
    except IndexError:
        logger.error("Not enough hashed flag parts to assign to all products")
        break

# Save the updated product data to security.txt in the hidden directory
data = {"products": products}
output_path = os.path.join("flask_app/hidden", "security.txt")
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(output_path), exist_ok=True)

with open(output_path, "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)
logger.info("JSON file successfully created at %s", output_path)
```

#### Key Algorithms:

1. **Flag Generation**
   - Combines a fixed challenge string (`#74q$j&zcB`) with a team-specific key
   - Applies SHA-256 hashing to create a unique flag
   - Formats it with the `FF{...}` prefix

2. **Flag Splitting**
   - Divides the flag into 9 equal parts
   - Each part will be assigned to a different product

3. **JSON Modification**
   - Assigns each flag part as the ID of a product
   - Saves the modified product data to security.txt in the hidden directory

### Component 3: Web Interface

The web interface is a simple cryptocurrency financial dashboard created with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and TradingView widgets.

#### Key Design Elements:
- Designed as a distraction with no direct hints to the hidden file
- Includes cryptocurrency charts and financial information
- Professionally styled with Tailwind CSS

### Component 4: Containerization

The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and isolation.

#### Dockerfile (`flask_app/Dockerfile`):

```dockerfile
FROM python:3

# Copy and install requirements
COPY flask_app/requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code and set working directory
COPY . code
WORKDIR /code

EXPOSE 80

# Run the Flask application
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "flask_app/app.py"]
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=80"]
```

#### Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`):

```yaml
version: '3'

volumes:
  my-django-data:

services:
  flask:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: flask_app/Dockerfile

    ports:
      - '80:80'

    environment:
      - TEAMKEY=XXXXXXX  # This value is replaced with a unique team key in the actual challenge
```

#### Container Design:

1. **Base Image**
   - Uses Python 3 as the foundation
   - Provides a consistent runtime environment

2. **Dependencies**
   - Installs required packages from requirements.txt
   - Primarily Flask and Werkzeug

3. **Networking**
   - Exposes port 80 for web traffic

4. **Environment Variables**
   - TEAMKEY: Team-specific key used in flag generation
   - Can be customized for each deployment

## Challenge Writeup

### Step 1: Web Enumeration
The first step is to use web enumeration tools to discover hidden endpoints. Using a tool like ffuf:

```bash
ffuf -w common.txt -u http://[challenge-ip]:[port]/FUZZ > output.txt
```

### Step 2: Identify the Hidden File
Analyzing the output reveals a hidden endpoint: `/security.txt`

### Step 3: Access the Hidden File
Visit the discovered URL: `http://[challenge-ip]:[port]/security.txt`

### Step 4: Extract the Flag Parts
The security.txt file contains JSON data with cryptocurrency products. Each product has an ID field containing a part of the flag.

### Step 5: Assemble the Flag
Collect all the product IDs in order and concatenate them to form the complete flag in the format `FF{...}`.

### Step 6: Submit the Flag
Submit the assembled flag to complete the challenge.

### Key Insights
1. The challenge tests web enumeration skills to find hidden endpoints
2. Understanding how to extract and reassemble parts of a fragmented flag is essential
3. The financial dashboard serves as a distraction with no useful information for solving the challenge

### Tools Used
- Web enumeration tool (e.g., ffuf, dirb, gobuster)
- Web browser to view the hidden file
- JSON parsing knowledge to extract flag parts
