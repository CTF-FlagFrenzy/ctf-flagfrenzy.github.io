## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

This challenge has 3 parts:

    1. **Building website**
    2. **Deploying website**
    3. **Capture website**

### Component 1: Building website

First the website has to be build. It contains a lot of blogs, where some flags are hidden. Also a secret blog is available and somewhere is a link to download the images for a QR-code and PDF file. All necessary files can be found on the CTF-FlagFrenzy repo.

### Component 2: Deploying website

To get the website published, a hosting service called Cloudflare was used because it was free. In this case another git repo was created containing the website and it then was linked to Cloudflare.

### Component 3: Capture website

To make it possible for the participants to find the real website, fake websites with a link to the real one was captured with archive.org.

**HAVE FUN**

## Challenge Writeup

### Step 1: Page Source

- Go to `archive.org` and search for the provided URL. As one can see there are some captures.
- Look through them and you can see at the bottom of the page a URL, that says `... realtimemachine. ...`.
- Test all links that are provided and as soon as you find one that works you have passed the first "test".
- In one of the captures the first flag is hidden, but you can get it also on the functional website. Inspect the page source and the flag will be found.

### Step 2: Secret Blog & QR-code

- To find a hidden file one has to use `dirbuster`. In this part the goal is to find this hidden file and have a look at the message in it.
- As shown above the secretblog.html suddenly appears. When visiting this page following clue gets displayed:
- After downloading the images, they have to be put together like this:
- After scanning the QR-code a text will appear. It looks like a flag but the text inside FF{} is encrypted.
- Next thing to do is to try  to let hashcat run over it. Like this the password was cracked rather fast.

### Step 3: Secret file

- When going through the blogs again, a difference can be spotted:

    ![alt text](media/image-09.png)

  - With this link a PDF file can be downloaded. The goal is to get the right password to the file. Inside that file, the flag is hidden.

**2. Crack Password**

- To crack the file get the hash of the file with pdf2john.
- Afterwards run JohnTheRipper with a wordlist your choice. I used rockyou.txt:
- Use it to open the PDF file. 
- In the file there are a lot of random letters, numbers and symbols. To find the flag Strg + F is used.

### Tools Used

* archive.org
* Kali Linux
* JohnTheRipper
* dirbuster
* Photoshop
* CyberChef

### Conclusion

In this challenge the participant has to use various tools to get to the goal. It is important to know them, because they're a must in the IT.
