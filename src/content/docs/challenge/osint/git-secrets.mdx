`Gits Secret: Layers of Discovery`is a challenge where the knowledge of GitHub is required. The idea is to get to know some pratical commands concerning GitHub, to know in the future how to easily find something in a bigger repository.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

This challenge has 3 parts:

    1. **GitHub Account**
    2. **GitHub Repository**
    3. **Actions**

### Component 1: GitHub Account

To begin with this challenge an account has to be created on GitHub. As soon as this is done, it can be designed and information can be added to make it look more trustworthy.
This is the one used for this challenge: https://github.com/ghostcoder0916

### Component 2: GitHub Repository

After forking a lot of other repos (so that the real one isn't found too easily) a new one is created. In there a script was run to make a lot of fake commits. The other things that have to be done are adding and then delteing the file again with a flag in it. Creating git tags with messages and adding a fake user identity.

#### Script fake commits
```python
import datetime as mydate
import os
import random
import uuid
import git

class FakeGit:
    def __init__(self):
        self.project_dir = os.path.realpath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
        self.min_commits = 45
        self.max_commits = 113
        self.repo = None
        self.remote_url = "https://github.com/ghostcoder0916/PhantomCode.git"
        self.repo_name = self.remote_url.split("/")[-1].split(".")[0]
        print("[Info]: Starting")

    def load_repo(self):
        try:
            print("[Info]: Loading git repository")
            self.repo = git.Repo(os.path.join(self.project_dir, self.repo_name))
            print("[Info]: Repo loaded")
        except git.exc.NoSuchPathError:
            print("[Error]: Repo not found. Creating new one from remote-url")
            os.mkdir(os.path.join(self.project_dir, self.repo_name))
            self.repo = git.Repo.clone_from(self.remote_url, os.path.join(self.project_dir, self.repo_name))

    def execute_commit(self, year: int, month: int, day: int):
        action_date = str(mydate.date(year, month, day).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
        os.environ["GIT_AUTHOR_DATE"] = action_date
        os.environ["GIT_COMMITTER_DATE"] = action_date
        self.repo.index.commit(message=f"{(uuid.uuid4())}")

    def single_commit(self, year: int, month: int, day: int):
        current_date = mydate.date(year, month, day)
        commits_amount = random.randint(self.min_commits, self.max_commits)
        print(f"Currently commiting {current_date} with {commits_amount} commits")
        for x in range(commits_amount):
            self.execute_commit(current_date.year, current_date.month, current_date.day)

    def many_commits(self, commit_start_date, commit_stop_date, mix=False):
        while True:
            self.single_commit(commit_start_date.year, commit_start_date.month, commit_start_date.day)
            random_days = random.randint(3, 9)
            if mix:
                commit_start_date = commit_start_date + mydate.timedelta(days=random_days)
            else:
                commit_start_date = commit_start_date + mydate.timedelta(days=1)
            if commit_start_date >= commit_stop_date:
                break

    def git_push(self):
        try:
            origin = self.repo.remote(name='origin')
            origin.push()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f'Error occurred while pushing the code !:\n{e}')
        else:
            print("Changes have been pushed !")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    FakeGit = FakeGit()
    FakeGit.load_repo()

    if input("1.Create single commit\n2.Range of commits\n>> ") == '1':
        provided_data = [int(x) for x in input("Date in format YYYY/MM/DD\n>> ").split("/")]
        FakeGit.single_commit(provided_data[0], provided_data[1], provided_data[2])
        FakeGit.git_push()
    else:
        start_date = [int(x) for x in input("Start date in format YYYY/MM/DD\n>> ").split("/")]
        stop_date = [int(x) for x in input("Stop date in format YYYY/MM/DD\n>> ").split("/")]

        start_date = mydate.date(start_date[0], start_date[1], start_date[2])
        stop_date = mydate.date(stop_date[0], stop_date[1], stop_date[2])

        FakeGit.many_commits(start_date, stop_date)
        FakeGit.git_push()
```

### Component 3: Actions

After everything is set up, the participant only has to run some git commands to get the flags.

**HAVE FUN**

## Challenge Writeup

### Step 1: Commit Message

A strange commit appeared in the PhantomCode repository. Rumors say it contains a secret message, but it's buried among countless fake commits. Can you find what PhantomCoder0916 was trying to communicate?

> [!TIP]
> Search commit messages carefully—one of them hides the truth.

- The first flag is hidden inside a commit message. To find it, search commit messages for the flag pattern:

```bash
git log --grep=FF{
```
- The command filters the commit history and displays only messages containing `FF{`, revealing the flag.

### Step 2: Deleted files

A crucial file once existed in the repository but was mysteriously deleted. What was in it? Why did PhantomCoder0916 erase it? Your task is to retrieve what was lost before it's gone for good.

> [!TIP]
> Look through the commit history to find traces of the missing file.

- Check the commit history for deleted files.
```bash
git log --diff-filter=D --summary
```
- Identify the deleted file's name and note its hash.

- Going to the repository online, you can search for the hash and have a look at the deleted file.

- If have a look at the commit before this one you don't have to decrypt the message by yourself.

### Step 3: Git Tag

Not all secrets are erased—some are cleverly hidden in plain sight. PhantomCoder0916 has been marking important milestones in the repository, but one of these marks conceals something unusual. Can you find the hidden message?

> [!TIP]
> Examine the tags carefully. One of them contains a secret.

- List all tags in the repository. 
```bash
git tag
```

- Inspect each tag's message using:
```bash
git show v1.0
git show v1.1
...
...
```
- One of these tag messages contains the flag.

### Step 4: Fake Account

Someone has been tampering with the repository—an unknown user who shouldn’t have access. But who is it? PhantomCoder0916 may have created a fake identity to cover their tracks. Find the imposter and expose their email address to uncover the final piece of the puzzle.

> [!TIP]
> Investigate the commit authors. One of them doesn’t belong.

- Display a list of contributors.
```bash
git shortlog -s -n
```
- Identify any suspicious or unknown commit authors.

- View commits made by a specific author to get the email address of the fake user.

- Submit the extracted email address as the flag.

### Tools Used

* Git commands

### Conclusion

This challenge required exploring various aspects of Git, including commit messages, deleted files, tags, and user metadata. By systematically applying Git commands, all hidden flags could be uncovered. These techniques are useful for real-world digital forensics and security investigations in Git repositories.
